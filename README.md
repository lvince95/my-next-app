#### Disclaimer:

This is just my attempt at exploring the best ways to build a fullstack web application using some of the best tools in the ecosystem with best practices in mind.

<h2 id="about">Application Overview</h2>

This is a fullstack application that consists of:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

- ‚ö° Full-stack React with Next.js
- ‚ö° Database ingeration with Prisma
- ‚ö° [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/pwa-checklist/) with good Lighthouse scores
- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è E2E typesafety with tRPC
- üé® Clean code with ESLint + Prettier
- üíö Pre-commit hooks with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to catch errors before you commit
- üíö CI setup using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions):
  - ‚úÖ Linting
  - ‚úÖ Unit and Integration testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
  - ‚úÖ Integration and E2E testing with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io)

<h2 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h2>

Most of the code lives in the `src` folder and looks like this:

```sh
src
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- features          # feature based modules
|
+-- hooks             # shared hooks used across the entire application
|
+-- lib               # re-exporting different libraries preconfigured for the application (if any)
|
+-- pages             # next.js pages configuration
|
+-- stores            # global state stores
|
+-- types             # base types used across the application
|
+-- utils             # shared utility functions
```

The main benefit of this folder structure is the use of the `features` folder. Grouping modules as features allows the application to be scaled in a more readable and maintainable way. For example, any code related to authentication will be stored in the `features/authentication` directory. This ensures that any code having any functionality related to authentication is kept inside its own features folder, separating it from other features. Any time a new feature is added, its own folder within the `features` folder will be created. Maintaining an application with this structure will be easier compared to applications that have a flat folder structure, with files that are unrelated to each other living in the same directory.

As for specific features, each feature could have the following structure:

```sh
src/features/example-feature
|
+-- components  # components scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- hooks       # hooks scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- stores      # state stores for a specific feature
|
+-- types       # typescript types for TS specific feature domain
|
+-- utils       # utility functions for a specific feature
|
+-- index.ts    # entry point for the feature, it should serve as the public API of the given feature
```

Everything from a feature should be exported from the `index.ts` file, which behaves as a public API of the feature.

Importing things from other features should be done in the following way:

`import {ExampleComponent} from "@/features/example-feature"`

and not

`import {AwesomeComponent} from "@/features/awesome-feature/components/AwesomeComponent`

You can also modify the ESLint configuration to allow imports to be done in the following way:

`import {ExampleComponent} from "@/example-feature"`

This was inspired by how [NX](https://nx.dev/) handles libraries that are isolated but available to be used by the other modules. Think of a feature as a library or a module that is self-contained but can expose different parts to other features via its entry point.

<h2 id="naming-convention">Naming Convention</h2>

Variables will be named using `camelCase`

```sh
# Variable
const pageCount = 5

# File
index.ts
useCustomHook.ts
```

Component names will be named using `PascalCase`. This also includes component files.

```sh
# Functional Component Declaration
const ExampleComponent = () => { return <></> }

# Component file
ExampleComponent.tsx
Button.tsx
```

This project uses PostgreSQL as the database (the provider can be changed easily). Models defined in the prisma schema must have tables that are named with lowercase and snake case. You can use the `@@map` API attribute as shown.

```sh
model User {
  id           Int           @id @default(autoincrement())
  email        String        @unique

  @@map(name: "user")
}

model PostDetails {
  id           Int           @id @default(autoincrement())
  content      string
  author       User          @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])

  @@map(name: "post_details")
}
```

With this model definition, Prisma automatically maps the `User` and `PostDetails` model to the `user` and `post_details` tables respectively in the underlying database.
