## Introduction

The tests are done in a scalable way as well. Whenever new test cases are added, they would be subjected to all of the current tests done. The tests done on all test cases are:

- Check if the portfolio allocation is accurate
- Check if the deposit plan amounts get deducted after allocation
- Check if the deposit plans that have been fully allocated are flagged as completed
- Check if there are any excess funds (should be 0 if none)

The test cases used are detailed below.

### Basic case

Deposit Plans

- One-Time
  - High Risk - $10000
  - Retirement - $500
- Monthly
  - High Risk - $0
  - Retirement - $500

Funds Deposited

- $10500
- $100

Expected Result:

- High Risk = $10000
- Retirment = $600

### Partial case (Funds < Total Allocation)

Deposit Plans

- One-Time (Priority = 1)
  - High Risk - $100
  - Retirement - $400
- One-Time (Priority = 2)
  - High Risk - $400
  - Retirement - $400

Funds Deposited

- $500
- $500

Expected Result

- High Risk = $440
- Retirment = $560

### Partial reversed case (The partial case, with the priority reversed)

Deposit Plans

- One-Time (Priority = 2)
  - High Risk - $100
  - Retirement - $400
- One-Time (Priority = 1)
  - High Risk - $400
  - Retirement - $400

Funds Deposited

- $500
- $500

Expected Result

- High Risk = $350
- Retirment = $650

### Partial different frequency case (The partial case, with different frequencies)

Deposit Plans

- One-Time (Priority = 1)
  - High Risk - $100
  - Retirement - $400
- Monthly (Priority = 2)
  - High Risk - $400
  - Retirement - $400

Funds Deposited

- $500
- $500

Expected Result

- High Risk = $350
- Retirment = $650

### Partial different frequency reversed case (Switch the frequencies)

Deposit Plans

- Monthly (Priority = 1)
  - High Risk - $100
  - Retirement - $400
- One-Time (Priority = 2)
  - High Risk - $400
  - Retirement - $400

Funds Deposited

- $500
- $500

Expected Result

- High Risk = $440
- Retirment = $560

### Partial date case (The partial case, with no priority but different dates)

Deposit Plans

- One-Time (Date = 2022-02-04)
  - High Risk - $100
  - Retirement - $400
- One-Time (Date = 2022-02-02)
  - High Risk - $400
  - Retirement - $400

Funds Deposited

- $500
- $500

Expected Result

- High Risk = $440
- Retirment = $560

### Partial date reversed case (Switch the dates)

Deposit Plans

- One-Time (Date = 2022-02-02)
  - High Risk - $100
  - Retirement - $400
- One-Time (Date = 2022-02-04)
  - High Risk - $400
  - Retirement - $400

Funds Deposited

- $500
- $500

Expected Result

- High Risk = $350
- Retirment = $650

### Excess funds case (The basic case, with excess funds)

Deposit Plans

- One-Time
  - High Risk - $10000
  - Retirement - $500
- Monthly
  - High Risk - $0
  - Retirement - $500

Funds Deposited

- $10500
- $1100

Expected Result:

- High Risk = $10000
- Retirment = $600
- $1000 returned
